       1             SENATOR MARCELLINO:  [Unintelligible], that

       2      you understand that, just to let everybody know.

       3             I'd like to call the meeting of the -- oh,

       4      you ready?

       5             We'll wait.

       6             UNKNOWN SPEAKER:  Jack's not ready yet, sir.

       7             SENATOR MARCELLINO:  We'll call the meeting

       8      of the Senate Investigations Committee and

       9      Government Operations to order.

      10             If we could all rise for Pledge of

      11      Allegiance.

      12             I pledge allegiance to the flag of the

      13      United States of America, and to the Republic for

      14      which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible,

      15      with liberty and justice for all.

      16             Thank you.

      17             I'm Senator Carl Marcellino, and I chair the

      18      Committee on Investigations and Government

      19      Operations for the New York State Senate.

      20             The purpose of this particular hearing is to

      21      consider possible infrastructure and construction

      22      improvements, zoning changes, beach protection,

      23      with rebuilding, in the aftermath of

      24      "Superstorm Sandy," to prevent the structure

      25      destruction from the next storm.

       1             The hearing, hopefully, will begin with

       2      discussion of all the changes our state needs to

       3      make, and consider, as we rebuild after

       4      "Superstorm Sandy," and prepare for the next one,

       5      because there will be a next one.

       6             We're early in the winter, early in the

       7      season, and the next one could be tomorrow, or the

       8      next day, or the next week.  We don't know.

       9             Hopefully, we get lucky and they all bypass

      10      us, but you can't count on that, so we have to

      11      prepare, going forward.

      12             I'm joined today by my colleague

      13      Senator Jack Martins, from the neighboring Senate

      14      district to the west.  And, others of my

      15      colleagues may drop in from time to time, and/or

      16      have sent representatives to observe.  All will

      17      get copies of the report.

      18             Just by way of quick background:

      19             On October 29th of last year,

      20      "Superstorm Sandy" hit Long Island and New York City

      21      with winds over 60 miles an hour.  The storm blew

      22      down trees, power lines, and caused significant

      23      coastal flooding, resulting in 305,000 housing

      24      units destroyed and damaged.

      25             The damage from "Sandy" revealed serious
