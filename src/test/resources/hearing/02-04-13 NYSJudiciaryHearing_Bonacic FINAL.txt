       1             SENATOR BONACIC:  [No audio] the Judiciary

       2      Committee.

       3             I would like to now commence the public

       4      hearing.

       5             We were supposed to start at twelve.  I'm

       6      running about ten minutes late.

       7             And, the public hearing will concern

       8      Governor Cuomo's Court of Appeal nominee,

       9      Professor Jenny Rivera, who is seated right in front

      10      of me.

      11             The purpose of the hearing is to fill the

      17      will gavel in, to start the Judiciary Committee

      18      meeting.

      19             To fill -- subsequently, we'll be filling the

      20      vacancy of the late Judge Theodore Jones, but that

      21      will be done sometime in March.

      22             Senator Sampson, my ranking member on

      23      Judiciary, is running a little late.  He'll be here,

      24      about 12:30 he's expected.
