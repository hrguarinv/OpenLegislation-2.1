       1             SENATOR SAVINO:  We are awaiting

       2      Senator Peralta.

       3             And, we want to make sure we have everyone

       4      who's participating or testifying.  Make sure you

       5      have your name on the list, or see my trusty

       6      assistant.

       7             I say this all the time, but then people go

       8      ahead and read the whole thing:  If we can get to

       9      potential questions, because I think that's what

      10      we'll want to hear.

      11             Let's wait a few minutes.

      12             Talk a amongst yourselves, and we'll get

      13      started very soon.

      14             Thank you.

      15                  [Pause in the proceeding.]

      16                  [The hearing resumed, as follows:]

      17             SENATOR SAVINO:  We're having a bicameral

      18      hearing this morning.  We're being joined by

      19      Assemblyman Brian Kavanagh.

      20             Senator Peralta has arrived, and so we're

      21      going to get started with this hearing on -- there's

      22      several pieces --

      23             First of all, I'm Senator Diane Savino.

      24      I represent the 23rd Senate District, which is

      25      South Brooklyn and parts of Staten Island.
