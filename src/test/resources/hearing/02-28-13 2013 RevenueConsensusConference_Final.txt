       1             ROBERT L. MEGNA:  Good afternoon.

       2             I think I would like to start the festivities

       3      today of the 2013 Economic and Revenue Consensus

       4      Forecasting Conference.

       5             And, today, we have no name tags in front of

       6      us, so I guess I will have to introduce people, but

       7      I know you know everyone that's here.

       8             First let me recognize:

       9             Senator John DeFrancisco, Chairman of the

      10      Senate Finance Committee;

      11             Senator Malcolm Smith, Vice Chairman of the

      12      Senate Finance Committee;

      13             Assemblyman Herman Farrell, Chairman of the

      14      Assembly Ways and Means Committee;

      15             Senator Liz Krueger, Ranking Member of the

      16      Senate Finance Committee;

      17             Assemblyman Robert Oaks, Ranking Member of

      18      the Assembly Ways and Means Committee;

      19             And let me also recognize, on the other side

      20      of the table, Bob Ward, Deputy Comptroller.

      21             As we do every year, each member will have an

      22      opportunity to provide some brief opening remarks.

      23             Afterwards, we'll hear testimony from a

      24      cross-section of experts who will offer their

      25      perspectives on the current economic and revenue
