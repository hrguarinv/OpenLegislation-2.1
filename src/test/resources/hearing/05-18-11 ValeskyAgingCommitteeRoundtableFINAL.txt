       1             SENATOR VALESKY:  I want to welcome everyone

       2      to -- this is called "a meeting of public interest."

       3      It's intended to be more of a roundtable discussion

       4      than what a public hearing would be.  And I thought

       5      that might serve our purposes better for the topic

       6      that we're discussing.

       7             For those of you who don't know, my name is

       8      Senator David Valesky.  I'm the chair of the

       9      Senate Aging Committee.

      10             And, I have an interest in gathering all of

      11      you together, and many of you have actually reached

      12      out to me in my office, to have a discussion about

      13      the SAGE Commission's work, and the work that

      14      they're doing right now, and what may or may not be

      15      included as part of their report as it relates to

      16      the state Office for the Aging.

      17             Just before we start, the reason for the

      18      microphones, we in the senate have -- as, hopefully,

      19      many of you know, are placing a high priority on

      20      transparency and openness in government.  So, this

      21      meeting is being webcast.  And that's why the

      22      technology, here.

      23             And, in fact, anyone who has any comments,

      24      who might be watching this, we certainly ask you to

      25      submit them to my office.
