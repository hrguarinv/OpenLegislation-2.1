       1             SENATOR MARCELLINO:  Good afternoon.

       2             I'm Senator Carl Marcellino.  I chair the

       3      Senate Committee on Investigations, Government

       4      Operations.

       5             And, I'm joined today by my colleague

       6      Senator Bonacic, who chairs the Committee on Racing,

       7      Gaming, and Wagering.

       8             I do expect the possibility that the -- that

       9      Senator Golden will be joining us, who also chairs

      10      the Civil Service and Pensions Committee.

      11             But, he is not here as yet, and we will

      12      start, in the interest of time, so we don't hold

      13      people up.

      14             This hearing is designed to assist the

      15      Legislature in identifying and learning about

      16      concerns on the delivery of services, the State

      17      workforce, and the cost savings in the proposed

      18      merger of the Lottery Commission, and the Racing and

      19      Wagering, into the gaming -- to one overall gaming

      20      situation.

      21             We want to make sure that we get all the

      22      information we possibly can.  We want to make sure

      23      we know what's going on, with the impacts on the

      24      workforce, the impacts on revenue, what may come

      25      from this procedure.
