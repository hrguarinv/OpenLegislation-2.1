       1             SENATOR ROBACH:  Okay, good afternoon,

       2      everybody.

       3             Thank you, everyone who is here, and those

       4      who will be giving testimony.

       5             I am Senator Joe Robach, and I'm very happy

       6      that we're having this hearing, and allowing people

       7      in Rochester to put in their comments, testimony,

       8      on the Governor's budget.

       9             I see several people in the room who have

      10      already contacted me via e-mail, or other ways,

      11      regarding proposals of the executive budget.

      12             But, I do want to both, introduce, and thank,

      13      think my two colleagues.

      14             First, Senator Pat Gallivan, the Chairman of

      15      the Social Services Committee, and,

      16      Senator Diane Savino, the Chairwoman of Children and

      17      Families Committee, for taking the time, to not only

      18      come here to Rochester, which I personally

      19      appreciate on behalf of everyone in this region that

      20      provides vital services; but, also, they've been

      21      going around the rest of the state, and I think this

      22      is very important, to give people the opportunity,

      23      firsthand, to chime in, put their comments on the

      24      record.

      25             Obviously, this is a very, very important
