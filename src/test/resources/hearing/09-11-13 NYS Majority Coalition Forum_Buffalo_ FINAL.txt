       1             SENATOR GALLIVAN:  Good morning, everybody.

       2             Thank you for being here today.

       3             I am Senator Pat Gallivan, joined by

       4      Senator Dave Valesky, Senator Kathy Marchione, and

       5      Senator Mark Grisanti, in what is the first of a

       6      series of ten industry-specific hearings to focus on

       7      regulations in New York State and our regulatory

       8      environment.

       9             Some of you may have been aware of a recent

      10      U.S. Chamber of Commerce "Enterprising States

      11      Report" that indicated New York State had the worst

      12      business climate in the nation: 50 out of 50.

      13             It's no secret, of course, for many of you,

      14      and for us, what has gotten us to this point are

      15      two areas: taxes and regulations.

      16             So we know about the high taxes.  We are

      17      trying to take those on.

      18             Some of our counterparts are actually

      19      conducting a series of statewide hearings, looking

      20      for ideas on tax reform.

      21             One will actually be held in Buffalo in city

      22      hall, I believe tomorrow --

      23             SENATOR VALESKY:  Tomorrow.

      24             SENATOR GALLIVAN:  -- at 10 a.m?

      25             SENATOR VALESKY:  10 a.m., yeah.
