       1             SENATOR FUSCHILLO:  Let me introduce my

       2      colleagues.

       3             To the right, Senator Marty Golden,

       4      Senator Billy Larkin; and to my left,

       5      Senator Liz Krueger.

       6             Thank you very much for being here.

       7             For the record, my name is

       8      Senator Charles Fuschillo, and I am the Chairman of

       9      the Senate Transportation Committee.

      10             Let me also thank all the speakers that are

      11      here today to offer testimony to the Committee.

      12             We know how busy you are, and we appreciate

      13      you taking time out of your schedule to be here.

      14             The MTA, as we know, is the largest

      15      transportation system in North America.

      16             It covers -- its area -- its service area

      17      covers of over 5,000 square miles.

      18             Its transit systems have an annual ridership

      19      of over 2.6 billion, and its bridges and tunnels

      20      serve more than 280 million vehicles a year.

      21             The operations are funded through a more than

      22      $13 million budget.

      23             The MTA has many longstanding issues with its

      24      finances.

      25             Fares have risen dramatically over the past
